## Karamoja Crop Yield Analysis
## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze crop yield data for sorghum and maize in the Karamoja region of Uganda. By leveraging satellite imagery and geographic information systems (GIS), we have identified factors influencing crop productivity, assessed the effectiveness of current agricultural practices, and provided recommendations for improving food security in the region.

## Key Findings

Significant variations in crop yields were observed across different districts and sub-counties within Karamoja.
Sorghum consistently outperformed maize in terms of yield, particularly in the northern districts.
Population growth and land pressure are emerging challenges that could impact future crop production.
## Recommendations

Prioritize investment in high-yielding sorghum varieties.
Improve agricultural practices in low-yielding areas.
Invest in infrastructure to enhance market access.
Diversify crop production to reduce risk.
Support climate resilience strategies.
Strengthen extension services.
Address population growth and land pressure.
